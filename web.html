 <h2>The death of Donavan Sheehan. In FNAF IN REAL TIME.</h2>

 <p>In the start of a cutscence when we see brother and we're in a 
    suit the suit we are in is the duck suit. And after the we die from
    willam afton. we hear phone guy but in a part he said "If your spirit roams around
    the halls like they do" And after we play as a another character. My theory
    is that the reason why the duck aka donavan who is inside the suit is attacking us is 
    because he thinks we are willam afton. And i think 
    That we are either playing as phone guy or another guard.
